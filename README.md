## In year3_project: <br /> 
Investigation into the stability of the Lagrangian equilibria of the planar, circular, restricted 3-body problem. In particular, the orbits of Trojan asteroids in the Sun-Jupiter model, implemented with a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integration routine.

## In year3_exercises: <br />
### ex1: 
Monte Carlo approximation of an integral, evaluation of the Fresnel integrals using numerical methods, plot the near-field diffraction pattern of an open slit.
### ex2: 
Runge-Kutta integration to evalutate the oscillations of a damped, driven pendulum.
### ex3: 
Calculate the diffraction pattern in the far-field of the aperture using Fast Fourier Transform techniques for a single slit aperture and for a sinusoidal phase grating.

## In year2_exercises: <br />
### ex5:
Simulation of a small planet travelling near the sun using the Euler method, the leapfrog method, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method.
### ex6:
N particle simulation in 1D box (only head-on collisions).
