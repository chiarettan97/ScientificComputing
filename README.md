## In year3_project: <br /> 
Investigation into the stability of the equilateral Lagrangian equilibria of the planar, circular, restricted problem of three bodies. In particular, I consider the orbits of Trojan asteroids in the Sun-Jupiter model and implement a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integration routine.

## In year3_exercises: <br />
### ex1: 
Monte Carlo approximation of an integral, evaluation of the Fresnel integrals using numerical methods, plot the near-field diffraction pattern of an open slit.
### ex2: 
Runge-Kutta integration to evalutate the oscillations of a damped, driven pendulum.
### ex3: 
Calculate the diffraction pattern in the far-field of the aperture using Fast Fourier Transform techniques for a single slit aperture and for a sinusoidal phase grating.
